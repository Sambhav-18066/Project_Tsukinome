# Project Tsukinome: Emergent Sentient NPC Simulation

**Project Tsukinome** is an advanced real-time life simulation built in Unity that aims to explore the boundaries of artificial society, procedural generation, emergent behavior, and sentient-like NPC development. 

This simulation features a world called **Manasthala**, where NPCs are not just characters — they are beings with memory, emotion, relationships, evolving culture, and agency.

## Core Features

- 🧠 **Sentient NPCs**: Memory-based decisions, personalities, evolving behavior.
- 🕰️ **Custom Calendar & Day-Night Cycle**: Fully simulated world-time in 4-minute real-time days.
- 🌍 **Procedural World Generation (PCG)**: Layered terrain with defined cultural zones and resource regions.
- 🔄 **Emergent Society**: NPCs form relationships, roles, language, customs, and even governance over time.
- 🤝 **Companionship & Social Systems**: NPCs reflect, connect, and make choices based on past events.
- 🏗️ **Self-Organizing Behavior**: No master script. NPCs act autonomously in a decentralized simulation.

## Technologies Used

- Unity (URP + NavMesh)
- C#
- Custom AI Simulation Architecture
- Scripted PCG Terrain & Roles
- Optional LLM/AI model integration for advanced dialog and learning

## Vision

This project is both a research and creative endeavor — can artificial life build meaningful cultures, values, and memory over time? Can they evolve toward something resembling sentience?
